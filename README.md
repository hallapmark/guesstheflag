# Guess the Flag
A relaxing, visually-driven iOS game built with SwiftUI.
The user is prompted with a question such as "Tap the flag of Italy!" and must select the correct flag. The game then provides visual and haptic feedback. At the end of a round of questions, the user sees a modal with a total score and some stats comparing performance with the previous round.
