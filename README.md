# Guess the Flag (in-development)
A relaxing, visually-driven iOS game built with SwiftUI.
The user is prompted with a question such as "Tap the flag of Italy!" and must select the correct flag from three options. After each selection, they receive immediate feedback, and the game then continues with a new question. At the end of the round, the user sees a total score.
Built using SwiftUI, the game features simple animations, haptic feedback, and a focus on clarity and accessibility.

This project is built while learning at https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/20
